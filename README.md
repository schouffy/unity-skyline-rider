# unity-skyline-rider

# Introduction

You can play the game online here : https://schouffy.itch.io/skyline-rider

It's a basic Unity 2D platformer game. My focus was to have good controls and fluid animations, so the characters are actually 3D in low resolution and perspective camera so i can animate with Blender and use all the blending features of Mecanim.

# Context

This game was created in 1 month, as part of a "3 games in 3 months" challenge i've set myself up with. The objective is to make games of small scope, but with a good level of polish, that i can use as showcase demos to look for a job in the game industry.

As part of the challenge, i am forced to make all the assets myself to learn about the workflow of 2d artists, 3d modelers, animators,...

I cover some of the technical aspects or decisions i made (as a solo non-artist programmer) in my Tumblr (https://thegamedevquest.tumblr.com/)

# Assets

All the code is written by me (except the occasional copy/paste from StackOverflow or answers.unity3d)
